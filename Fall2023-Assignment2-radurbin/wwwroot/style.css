CSS:
    - Set the background of the page to an image of your choice. Unsplash is a great resource for free images.
    - Set the visibility of the "searchResults" and "time" divs to hidden.
    - Style the rest of the page however you see fit. points will be lost if little or no effort is given in styling your site.
BONUS:
    - Implement a "I'm feeling lucky" button. This button should take the user to the first web page returned from your search API.
    - Modify the function that changes your background image so that each click cycles through two different images without refreshing the page.
